I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

• Lab 3, Part 1 and 2

  This lab was one of my favorites because I enjoyed working with my 2 partners, and the whole process went smoothly. We calculated BMR using code and I gained the most understanding throughout the lab. Towards the end of part 1 and part 2,   I finally understood how to check for format and lint errors.

• Lab 8, Part 1

  This lab was one of my favorites to work on because we worked on how to use loops. Not only did we work with loops, I figured out how to work with vectors throughout the process. I also really enjoyed the feeling of clearing all of the      make format and lint errors at the end of part 1.

• Lab #9, Part 1

  This lab was one of my favorites because of the satisfaction me and my partner felt every time we fixed our errors. This lab was focused on writing loops and declaring empty vectors, and we had some struggles. However, we learned a lot      through this lab on how to write loops and gave us much more knowledge.
